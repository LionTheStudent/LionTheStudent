### Hi, Iâ€™m Lion ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a student and a passionate coder who loves to work with
python, C#, C++ and reverse engineering. I'm currently learning HTML CSS JS and PHP because C++ doesn't payðŸ˜†
I enjoy learning new things and solving challenging problems.
Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and collaborate with other developers.

You can reach me on my Discord: lionrapper ðŸŽ®
